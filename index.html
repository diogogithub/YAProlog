	&nbsp;<p class="style1"><strong>YAP</strong> is a high-performance Prolog compiler 
	developed at <a href="http://www.ncc.up.pt/liacc">LIACC</a>/<a href="http://www.up.pt">Universidade 
	do Porto</a> and at <a href="http://www.cos.ufrj.br/">COPPE Sistemas</a>/<a href="http://www.ufrj.br/">UFRJ</a>. 
	Its Prolog engine is based in the WAM (Warren Abstract Machine), with 
	several optimizations for better performance. <strong>YAP</strong> follows 
	the Edinburgh tradition, and is largely compatible with the ISO-Prolog 
	standard and with Quintus and SICStus Prolog. <strong>YAP</strong> has been 
	developed since 1985. The original version was written in assembly, C and 
	Prolog, and achieved high performance on m68k based machines. The assembly 
	code was used to implement the WAM emulators. Later emulators supported the 
	VAX, SPARC, and MIPS architectures. Work on the more recent version of
	<strong>YAP</strong> strives at several goals: </p>

	<ul>
		<li class="style2">
		<p class="style1">Portability: The whole system is now written in C.
		<strong>YAP</strong> compiles in popular 32 bit machines, such as Suns 
		and Linux PCs, and in a 64 bit machines, the Alphas running OSF Unix and 
		Linux. </p>
		</li>
		<li class="style2">
		<p class="style1">Performance: We have optimised the emulator to obtain 
		performance comparable to or better than well-known Prolog systems. In 
		fact, the current version of <strong>YAP</strong> performs better than 
		the original one, written in assembly language. &nbsp;</p>

		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="style1">Robustness: We have tested the system with a large 
		array of Prolog applications. </p>
		</li>
		<li class="style2">
		<p class="style1">Extensibility: <strong>YAP</strong> was designed 
		internally from the beginning to encapsulate manipulation of terms. 
		These principles were used, for example, to implement a simple and 
		powerful C-interface. The new version of <strong>YAP</strong> extends 
		these principles to accomodate extensions to the unification algorithm, 
		that we believe will be useful to implement extensions such as 
		constraint programming.</p>

		</li>
		<li class="style2">
		<p class="style1">Completeness: <strong>YAP</strong> has for a long time 
		provided most builtins expected from a Edinburgh Prolog implementation. 
		These include I/O functionality, data-base operations, and modules. Work 
		on <strong>YAP</strong> aims now at being compatible with the Prolog 
		standard. &nbsp;</p>

		</li>
		<li class="style2">
		<p class="style1">Openess: We would like to make new development of
		<strong>YAP</strong> open to the user community. &nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li class="style2">
		<p class="style1">Research: <strong>YAP</strong> has been a vehicle for 
		research within and outside our group. Currently research is going on on 
		parallelisation and tabulation, and support for <a href="clpbn">Bayesian 
		Networks</a>. </p>

		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="style1">YAP 4.0 and early versions of YAP 4.1 were distributed 
	under a <a href="license.html">license</a> that enables free use in academic 
	environments. From Yap4.1.15 onwards YAP is distributed under Perls&#39;s
	<a href="Artistic">Artistic</a> license. We would like to follow an open 
	development model: sources to the system are always made available from the 
	home page, and contributions from users are most welcome! </p>
